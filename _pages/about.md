I am currently an undergraduate student at Xidian University, class of 2021. I started my research internship in 2023 under the supervision of Professor [De Cheng](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/dcheng/index.html) and Professor [Chaowei Fang](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/FANGCHAOWEI/zh_CN/index.htm). 
In 2024, my first-author conference paper was accepted at NeurIPS 2024: [PDF](https://yycfq.github.io/files/24NeurIPS_LatentSpaceOOD%20(9).pdf).
After studying various generative models and their applications, I became particularly interested in generative models and multimodal generation. My goal is to build a unified multimodal large model capable of both understanding and generation. 
I am currently preparing for PhD applications for 2025. If you're interested in my work, feel free to reach out to me via email: [yycfq@foxmail.com](mailto:yycfq@foxmail.com).
